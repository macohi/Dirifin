# _append

This mainly applies to `data/` files, but here if you make a text file with the same name as a text file in `data/`. Let's use `data/credits.txt` for an example.

If you have `_append/data/credits.txt` anything you add in that file will be added to `data/credits.txt` in-game and you've just added extra credits.
