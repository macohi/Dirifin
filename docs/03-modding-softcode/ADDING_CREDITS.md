# Adding Credits

If you want to add credits to your mod, there are 2 ways of doing so: [Overriding](#overriding), or [Appending](#appending).

## Overriding

If you want to override the credits text file

then you just have to create a text file named `credits`

in the `data` directory of your mod.

## Appending

If you want to append credits to the game's credits,

then in the `_append/data` folder

you'll wanna create a text file named `credits`.

# After

and then after you do either one of those you're done!
