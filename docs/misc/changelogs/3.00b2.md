# 3.00 Pre-Release 2 - 2/??/2026

Hello! Nice little message for ya since the changelog format has changed to be more like minecraft.
Also the changelogs are now on the mdbook so changelogs aren't included in the exported game anymore.

## Fixed

- Fixed being able to select options while selecting an option in all menus
