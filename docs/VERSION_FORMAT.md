# Version Format

Using a custom version format cause why not.

Half inspired by Geometry dash's version system.

## Major versions (x.\__)

Major versions reset the minor version number and +1 to the major version number to 0.

They are big content updates such as a new level, or just a bunch of changes.

## Minor versions (\_.y_)

Minor versions are a +10 increment to the minor version number

They are smaller content updates such as a new menu, new enemy type maybe.

## Patch versions (\_._z)

Patch versions are a +1 increment to the minor version number.

They fix bugs. That's mostly it.

If something was missing like an asset or a sound, patch updates can add those.
